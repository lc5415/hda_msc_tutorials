# Tutorial for using CART Decision Trees.

This tutorial goes through the use of the implementation of decision trees provided by scikit-learn on the Iris dataset and the [PIMA-INDIAN Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data).

Note that this tutorial uses the `graphviz` python modules. It is included in the `requirements.txt` file, so you can install it by running the following in from the current folder:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

or 

```conda install --file requirements.txt``` 

if you are using `Anaconda`.

Otherwise, you should be able to install it individually using:

```pip install graphviz```

or 

```conda install -c anaconda graphviz```.
