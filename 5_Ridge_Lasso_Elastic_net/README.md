# 5 - Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net

This tutorial has imperfect solutions. It was originally written by Dr. Seth Flaxman in R. Mariana Clare later translated it into Python. We noticed during the tranlsation that the Python defaults within the libraries inherently do not match the models produced in R. We are still tuning hyperparameters to see if we can achieve a closer match. Please use these solutions for now.
