# Final Project Requirements

This document all the requirements for the final project. The aim is to ensure you can take the theory taught throughout the term and apply it to a real medical dataset. Please read the following information carefully to ensure the highest marks possible for your work.

## The Dataset

Your dataset must be realistic and approved by the class staff. Here are some guidelines:

* Must be medical or directly related to something medical (e.g. heart disease, medical appointments)
* Must be complex in at least one dimension; more than 10,000 records with at least 10 unique features or 10,000 features
* Only one dataset is allowed for the entire project (supervised and unsupervised)
	* You can join two or more datasets that are related to increase the complexity in its dimensions

If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to Dr. Sesh Kumar or one of the GTAs.

## The Project

We are looking for complete understanding of the concepts being applied to a real example. You must show the following:

* Ability to clean and format data in Python or R
* Clear understanding of the data and reasonable research questions to answer based on the data given
* Visualise the information to demonstrate reasoning for feature selection
* Capable of explaining every aspect of the project
* Implement both one supervised model and one unsupervised model to answer pertinent research question(s)
* Present the research questions and solutions to the teaching staff in a logical manner

For the final oral presentation, demonstrate your understanding with a clear, logical solution. We want to make sure you leave this course with the confidence that, given a dataset, you can consider questions and solutions from a machine learning perspective when appropriate.

Here are some points to consider as you complete the project.

* Visualise to express reasoning rather than telling us
* Apply verbage from the course during the presentation. We need to know you learned something from the course
* You may be asked to show your code; make it clean and comment it, for everyone's sake
* Discuss potential solutions or questions you thought of while going through the process. We want to know how you went about the process, not if you got the right answer
	* That being said, if there is some concern about your results, we will ask if you have tried alternative methods. Be prepared
	
If you are concerned about any aspect of the project, ask us. Communication is hard; ask us to clarify if something is confusing or something is troubling you.

The presentation will be 15 minutes long. Plan to present for 10 minutes and prepare to be asked a few questions afterwards.
